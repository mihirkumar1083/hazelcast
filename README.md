This program basically demonstrate the usage of Hazelcast distributed execution service and chunks mysql data and process them in parallel
and aggregate the final out put 

Hazelcast setup is very simple so if some one want to go with 10 node capasity this will be very good framework which supports distributed
multithreading.

Usage Download as Maven project prepare the sample mysql data and run HazelCastDistributedRunnerMain program.
